Data Scientist

Built something out of data

=====Just build something with Data and expect to suck at it for a while

Mathematics - VIMP
	MIT Linear algebra open cource
	MIT Calculus open cource
	MIT stats and probability open cource

Programming language - 
	Python - do lots of general programming.. don't start as if u want it to use for machine learning directly

- The Machien learning pipeline
	Find Data(Webscrape, APIs, CSVs)
	Clean the data(remove NaNs and infinities, should that be a string? probably not, maybe i can categorize it..)
	Choose the tune your algorithm
	Visualize results (imp)
	GOOGLE AND STACK OVERFLOW ARE YOUR FRIENDS :))
- scikit
++++++++
- Learn the math (1-2 months)
- Learn programming lang
- Machine learning tutorials and test projects
- Short term passion projects (Farmarket.in mine)

---------------------
- You are gona fail. A lot. Dont worry. be prepared to fail.
- Track ur projects on GitHub and write up your results
